## 📉 **Project : Customer Churn Prediction**
**Objective:**  
This project aimed to predict whether customers are likely to churn based on their historical interactions and demographic data. Churn prediction enables proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

**Steps Involved:**  
- 🔍 **Data Exploration:**  
  * Conducted EDA to identify trends and correlations between features and churn.  
  * Visualized data distributions for categorical and numerical features using pie charts, pair plots, and box plots.  
  * Used heatmaps to check correlations between numerical features.  
- 🔧 **Feature Engineering:**  
  * Addressed incorrect data types and scaled numerical features using outlier-robust scalers.  
  * Dealt with class imbalance using techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE.  
- 🤖 **Model Training:**  
  * Trained multiple models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost on different sampling techniques.  
  * Conducted hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.  
- 📊 **Evaluation:**  
  * Evaluated models using confusion matrices and ROC-AUC.  
- 🖥️ **Deployment:**  
  * Developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for visualizing predictions and insights.
