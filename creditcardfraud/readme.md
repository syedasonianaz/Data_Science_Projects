## 🏠 **Project : House Price Prediction**
**Objective:**  
The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of rooms, and other amenities. Accurate house price predictions help buyers and sellers make informed decisions, improving efficiency in the real estate market.

**Steps Involved:**  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:**  
  * Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values using mean and mode imputation.  
  * Scaled numerical features to ensure uniformity and encoded categorical variables.  
- 🔧 **Feature Engineering:**  
  * Created new features such as "BsmtHalfBath" and reduced the dimensions of the dataset.  
- 🤖 **Model Selection and Training:**  
  * Trained an XGBoost model, leveraging its ability to handle feature interactions and missing values effectively.  
  * Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.  
- 📊 **Evaluation:**  
  * Assessed model performance using RMSE and MAE to evaluate prediction accuracy.
