## 👥 **Project : Customer Segmentation**
**Objective:**  
This project aimed to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior, demographic data, and other attributes. Customer segmentation helps businesses create personalized marketing strategies, boosting customer retention and sales.

**Steps Involved:**  
- 🔍 **Data Exploration:**  
  * Analyzed the dataset to understand relationships between features.  
  * Visualized data using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to identify patterns.  
- 🔧 **Feature Engineering:**  
  * Created new features such as "Age Group" to uncover latent patterns.  
  * Used K-Means to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting an elbow graph.  
  * Standardized features to improve clustering model performance.  
- 🤖 **Model Training:**  
  * Applied clustering techniques, including K-Means and hierarchical clustering.  
  * Tested models with and without feature scaling for comparison.  
- 📊 **Evaluation:**  
  * Visualized clusters using contour plots.  
  * Analyzed centroids to interpret customer group characteristics.
