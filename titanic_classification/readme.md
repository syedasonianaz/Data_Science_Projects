## 🚢 **Project : Titanic Classification**
**Objective:**  
The objective was to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning. This binary classification problem helps in understanding factors that influence survival in catastrophic events.

**Steps Involved:**  
- 🔍 **Data Exploration:**  
  * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends between survival and features like gender, age, class, and ticket fare.  
  * Visualized data using histograms, box plots, and bar charts.  
- 🔧 **Feature Engineering:**  
  * Handled missing values in the dataset, particularly for "Age" using imputation and "Cabin" features.  
  * Encoded categorical variables like "Sex" and "Embarked."  
- 🤖 **Model Training:**  
  * Trained models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and several others.  
- 📊 **Evaluation:**  
  * Measured model performance using accuracy.
