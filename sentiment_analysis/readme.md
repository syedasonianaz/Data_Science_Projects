## 💬 **Project : Sentiment Analysis**
**Objective:**  
This project focused on building a text classification system to categorize user reviews or comments as positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is widely used in business applications to gauge customer feedback and brand perception.

**Steps Involved:**  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:**  
  * Removed noise such as HTML tags, special characters, and stop words.  
  * Tokenized text into meaningful units using NLTK.  
  * Normalized text data using lemmatization for consistency.  
- 📐 **Feature Extraction:**  
  * Extracted numerical representations of text using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Count Vector.  
- 🤖 **Model Training:**  
  * Implemented Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models, both of which are well-suited for text classification tasks.  
- 📊 **Evaluation:**  
  * Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on both datasets: TF-IDF and Count Vector.
