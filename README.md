## Project 1: House Price Prediction

**Objective:**  To predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.

**Feature Engineering:** Created new features to improve model performance.

**Model Selection and Training:** Trained an XGBoost model on the dataset.

**Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis
**Objective:** To classify text as positive, negative, or neutral using sentiment analysis.

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and tokenized the text data.

**Feature Extraction:** Used TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.

**Model Training:** Trained Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.

**Evaluation:** Evaluated the models' performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project 3: Titanic Classification
**Objective:** To predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning.

**Data Exploration:** Analyzed the dataset to understand the relationships between features and survival.

**Feature Engineering:** Encoded the categorical features.

**Model Training:** Trained multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and compared their performance.

**Evaluation:** Evaluated the models' performance using accuracy.

## Project 4: Customers Segmentation
**Objective:** To classify customers into different clusters/group.

**Data Exploration:** Analyzed the dataset to understand the relationships between features and patterns. Used scatterplot to visualize if dataset have prominent clusters or not.

**Feature Engineering:** Created Age group to check if it shows the patterns, that will help more in clustering.

**Model Training:** Trained multiple models (e.g., Kmeans and hierarchical clustering with scaling features and without scaling) and compared their results.

**Evaluation:** Evaluated the models' performance using contour plot and checked centroid and decision boundaries of clusters.

## Project 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective:** To classify transactions into different fraud or not.

**Data Exploration:** Dataset was numerical and with no details about columns, only amount and time with class were there to deal with.

**Feature Engineering:** Columns were on different scale with high imbalance class used scaling techniques to deal with imbalance class.

**Model Training:** Trained models on different type of scaling techniques to check model's performance.

**Evaluation:** Evaluated the models' performance using confusion matrix and compared performance of different models with different sampling techniques.
