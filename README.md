## Project 1: House Price Prediction

**Objective:**  To predict house prices using machine learning techniques.
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
**Feature Engineering:** Created new features to improve model performance.
**Model Selection and Training:** Trained an XGBoost model on the dataset.
**Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis
**Objective:** To classify text as positive, negative, or neutral using sentiment analysis.
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and tokenized the text data.
**Feature Extraction:** Used TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
**Model Training:** Trained Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.
**Evaluation:** Evaluated the models' performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project 3: Titanic Classification
**Objective:** To predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning.
**Data Exploration:** Analyzed the dataset to understand the relationships between features and survival.
**Feature Engineering:** Encoded the categorical features.
**Model Training:** Trained multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and compared their performance.
**Evaluation:** Evaluated the models' performance using accuracy.
